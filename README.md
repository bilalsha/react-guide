This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am learning react so I am adding code that I learn each time. Hope it helps other. Each branch contain specific topic and a assignment to cover that topic.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
